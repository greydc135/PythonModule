# Program Summary
This program is a very simple list, organizing three
attrributes and displaying accordingly. You can add
to the list, as well as delete from it. I may decide
to allow editing of each individual attribute later
on.

# A Problem...?
I tried multiple times to run this line in the terminal:

```
py -m venv venv
```

When I did, I always got the message:
Can't find a default Python.

I am not sure what this means, and will this be a
detriment to my grade?
